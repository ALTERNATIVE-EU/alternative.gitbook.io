# ALTERNATIVE Platform - User Guide

The web platform, made with [CKAN](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/user-guide.html), can be used to manage, publish and find data. It also has an API, which can be used by generating an [API Token](users.md#api-tokens); and a [python library](https://github.com/ALTERNATIVE-EU/alternative-lib) - for searching datasets and downloading resources.
