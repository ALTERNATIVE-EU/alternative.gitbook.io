## Keycloak

**Keycloak**, established as an industry-recognized solution for security, is deployed as the primary user credential management service within the **ALTERNATIVE** platform. It offers robust identity and access management (IAM) capabilities, which are crucial for securing sensitive data and resources. Keycloak's integration across the platform facilitates Single Sign-On (SSO) across all user-facing applications, significantly streamlining the authentication process while upholding stringent security standards.

A key feature of Keycloak is its ability to provide fine-grained access control, which is integrated tightly into various end-user applications. This feature allows for a more nuanced and tailored approach to access management, ensuring that users have the appropriate level of access for their roles. Furthermore, Keycloak supports advanced security features such as Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), adding an additional layer of security and significantly bolstering the platform's defense against unauthorized access.

Keycloak's use of the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol, which is based on OAuth 2.0, further underscores its robustness and adaptability in the realm of secure user authentication and authorization. This protocol not only enhances the security of the platform but also ensures compatibility and ease of integration with a wide range of applications and services. The combination of these advanced features positions Keycloak as a comprehensive and secure solution for managing user credentials and access within the **ALTERNATIVE** platform.
