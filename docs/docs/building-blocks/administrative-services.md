# Administrative Services

This section details the administrative services integral to the **ALTERNATIVE** platform, focusing on user credential management, DNS management, certificate lifecycle management, and ingress traffic handling. These services are essential for ensuring platform security, accessibility, and efficient operation.

## Keycloak

**Keycloak**, established as an industry-recognized solution for security, is deployed as the primary user credential management service within the **ALTERNATIVE** platform. It offers robust identity and access management (IAM) capabilities, which are crucial for securing sensitive data and resources. Keycloak's integration across the platform facilitates Single Sign-On (SSO) across all user-facing applications, significantly streamlining the authentication process while upholding stringent security standards.

A key feature of Keycloak is its ability to provide fine-grained access control, which is integrated tightly into various end-user applications. This feature allows for a more nuanced and tailored approach to access management, ensuring that users have the appropriate level of access for their roles. Furthermore, Keycloak supports advanced security features such as Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), adding an additional layer of security and significantly bolstering the platform's defense against unauthorized access.

Keycloak's use of the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol, which is based on OAuth 2.0, further underscores its robustness and adaptability in the realm of secure user authentication and authorization. This protocol not only enhances the security of the platform but also ensures compatibility and ease of integration with a wide range of applications and services. The combination of these advanced features positions Keycloak as a comprehensive and secure solution for managing user credentials and access within the **ALTERNATIVE** platform.

## External-DNS

The **External-DNS** service plays a pivotal role in the **ALTERNATIVE** platform by automating the management of DNS records for the platform's applications and services. This dynamic service is designed to respond to changes within the platform's environment, ensuring that DNS entries are consistently accurate and current. Such automation is crucial in a cloud-native environment, where service endpoints and their corresponding IP addresses are often allocated dynamically and can change frequently. This feature of external-dns significantly aids in maintaining the discoverability and accessibility of services, a key aspect of efficient cloud operations.

An essential function of the DNS server within this context is to map human-readable URLs to these dynamically allocated IP addresses. This mapping is not only vital for user convenience and the seamless operation of the platform but also plays a critical role in the platform's security infrastructure. Specifically, the DNS entries managed by external-dns are a prerequisite for the issuance of TLS certificates by the **Cert-manager**. These certificates, essential for encrypting data and securing communications, rely on accurate DNS records to validate the authenticity of the platform's services.

By integrating the external-dns service with the platform's DNS server and cert-manager, the **ALTERNATIVE** platform ensures a cohesive and secure environment. This integration allows for the seamless issuance and management of TLS certificates, bolstering the platform's overall security posture while ensuring that services remain easily accessible and identifiable to users. The combination of these technologies exemplifies a well-architected cloud environment, prioritizing both operational efficiency and stringent security measures.

## Cert-manager

**Cert-manager** is used for managing the lifecycle of SSL/TLS certificates for the platform's applications and services. It automates certificate issuance, renewal, and management processes by interfacing with Let's Encrypt, a certificate authority provider. This service is essential for ensuring encrypted and secure communication channels across the platform, thereby enhancing data security and integrity.

## Ingress Controller

The platform employs an **NGINX-based ingress controller** to manage and route ingress traffic to the appropriate internal services. This controller acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer, handling incoming HTTP/S requests and directing them based on URL paths and other criteria. The ingress controller is a critical component for managing external access to the platform's services, providing a secure and efficient gateway for incoming traffic.

Each of these administrative services plays a vital role in the overall functionality and security of the **ALTERNATIVE** platform. They are configured and maintained to ensure optimal performance, security compliance, and seamless integration with other platform components. All of the administrative services are deployed and run on top of Kubernetes.

## Istio Service Mesh

**Istio** is a service mesh that provides a comprehensive solution for managing microservices within the **ALTERNATIVE** platform. It offers advanced features such as traffic management, security, and observability, enhancing the platform's operational capabilities and security posture.

The platform leverages Istio's envoy filters to implement custom security policies, such as access control, and authentication. These policies help protect the platform from various security threats and ensure that only authorized traffic is allowed to access the services.
