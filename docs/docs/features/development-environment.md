## Development environment based on JUPYTERHUB

JupyterHub is leveraged to provide a multi-user development environment for data scientists and engineers collaborating on analytical workloads. It provides on-demand access to ephemeral notebook servers and IDEs, configured dynamically with language kernels, libraries, attached storage volumes, and access privileges depending on the user and context.

Key advantages include scalability, as JupyterHub handles provisioning secure single-user workspaces on a Kubernetes cluster to serve users simultaneously. The workspace isolation also creates personalization allowing custom tool and dependency configuration per project needs. JupyterHub provides a rich interface over kernels like Python, R, and Scala for code, visualizations, documentation while integrating with version control and data platforms.

Overall JupyterHub enables self-service access data science workbenches with security, governance, and devops service delivery advantages through Kubernetes backend automation. Notebooks can be easily shared between users and published to broader teams as standardized workflows or ML models are created. The workspace environment keeps evolving via community-sourced JupyterHub extensions too.
