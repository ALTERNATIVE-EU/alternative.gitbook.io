## Multi-user & collaboration support

Supporting secure collaboration across diverse teams is a key requirement shaping the ALTERNATIVE platform software architecture and component integrations. The ability for project researchers, partner company scientists, and designated regulators to seamlessly access permitted datasets or analytical workflows facilitates improved transparency and oversight over model development stages.

Additional collaboration-enhancing platform capabilities span multi-tenant Jupyter notebooks with selective content visibility and CKAN extension points to customize experiences for different user groups.

### Dataset Collaborators:

In the Collaborators tab there is a list of all users that have been given special permission to the dataset (collaborators don't have to be members of the organization that owns the dataset). From the list the collaborators can be deleted or their role changed. Here are the collaboratorâ€™s roles and rights:

- **Member** - can access the dataset if private, but not edit it
- **Editor** - can edit the dataset and its resources, as well as accessing the dataset if private
- **Admin** - in addition to managing the dataset, they can add and remove collaborators
