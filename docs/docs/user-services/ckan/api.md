# CKAN API

CKAN exposes an API which is more thoroughly documented [here](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/api/index.html). The API exposes most of CKAN’s features and is the preferred way to work with datasets. Jupyter users who want to pull data from CKAN can use this API directly or use Python’s `alternative-lib` library.
